DESCRIPTION

Our goal is to create high resolution whole mouse brain datasets with
fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST) imaging
method for reconstructing complete morphologies of specific individual
neurons. Transgenic or viral strategies were used to sparsely label
specific neuron populations in the brain with fluorescent reporters.
For whole-brain imaging, the intact brain was embedded in glycol
methacrylate resin. By using the fMOST technology, each embedded brain
can be imaged at 0.3 x 0.3 x 1 micron resolution. This entire strategy
can acquire a three-dimensional image set that can identify dendrites,
axons and their terminals across the whole mouse brain. The complete
morphology of each individual neuron, including its soma, dendrites
and axon arborization, was fully reconstructed using the Vaa3D
platform. The brain imaging datasets and the neuronal reconstructions
are registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework v3
(CCFv3).
